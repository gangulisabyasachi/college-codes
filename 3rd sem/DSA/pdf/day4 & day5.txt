5. delFront(): Remove the element at the start of a singly linked list
6. delEnd(): Remove the element at the end of a singly linked list
7. delOne(x): Remove one occurrence of x from a singly linked list
8. delAll(x): Remove all occurrences of x from a singly linked list
9. retFront(i): Return the i-th element from the start of a singly linked list
10. retEnd(i):: Return the i-th element from the start of a singly linked list
