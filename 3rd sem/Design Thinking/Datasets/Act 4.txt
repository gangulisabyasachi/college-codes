Act 4, Scene 1:

Summary:  
Macbeth visits the witches to learn more about his future. The witches show him three apparitions: an armored head warning him to beware Macduff, a bloody child telling him that no man born of a woman will harm him, and a child crowned with a tree in his hand saying that Macbeth will not be vanquished until Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane. Macbeth is reassured by these prophecies but becomes enraged when he learns that Banquo’s descendants will be kings. The scene concludes with the witches showing Macbeth a vision of a line of kings descended from Banquo.

Analysis:  
This scene deepens Macbeth’s sense of invincibility and paranoia. The apparitions’ prophecies provide him with a false sense of security, as they are designed to be ambiguous and misleading.
