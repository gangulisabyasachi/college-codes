Macbeth by William Shakespeare

Act 1, Scene 1
	Summary:  Thunder and lightning crash above a Scottish moor. Three haggard old women, the witches, appear out of the storm. In eerie, chanting tones, they make plans to meet again upon the heath, after the battle, to confront Macbeth. As quickly as they arrive, they disappear.
	
	Analysis: Macbeth begins in "an open place" — a place without any landmarks or buildings — with the appearance of the three "weird sisters," as they later call themselves. The Old English word "wyrd," or "weird" means "Fate," which is exactly the origin of these Witches.They are the Fates of classical mythology, one of whom spun the thread of a person's life, one of whom measured it, and one of whom cut it. The bleakness of the scene is a dramatic representation both of the wild Scottish landscape in which the play is set and the more universal wilderness of man's existence.The Three Witches' speech is written in short rhyming verse that imitates the casting of a spell. The women's language is also full of the imagery of witchcraft and of chaotic weather: thunder, lightning, rain, fog, and "filthy air." The lines "When the battle's lost and won" and "Fair is foul and foul is fair" are the most significant in the scene. On the one hand, these contradictory statements are the kind of riddles we would expect from witches; on the other, the lines suggest a paradox that runs throughout the play: Life frequently presents a confused picture of events in which discerning truth from falsehood is difficult.

	Poetic devices: Chiasmus: This is a rhetorical device where two or more clauses are balanced against each other by the reversal of their 			structures. An example is the famous line, "Fair is foul, and foul is fair".

			Antithesis: This device contrasts two opposing ideas in a balanced manner. For instance, "When the battle’s lost, and 				won".

			Rhyming Couplets: The witches speak in rhyming couplets, which gives their speech a rhythmic, spell-like quality. For 				example, "When shall 	we three meet again / In thunder, lightning, or in rain?".

			Imagery: The scene is rich with imagery related to chaos and the supernatural, such as thunder, lightning, and "filthy 				air".

Act 1,Scene2:
	
	Summary:  In Act 1, Scene 2 of Macbeth,King Duncan of Scotland receives reports about the ongoing battle against the Norwegian 	           invaders and Scottish rebels. A wounded captain informs Duncan that Macbeth, the Thane of Glamis, has shown great bravery by   defeating the rebel Macdonald and fighting valiantly against the Norwegians.The Thane of Ross then arrives with news that the Thane of Cawdor has betrayed Scotland by siding with the enemy. Duncan orders the execution of the Thane of Cawdor and decides to bestow his title upon Macbeth as a reward for his loyalty and courage.This scene highlights Macbeth's heroism and sets the stage for his rise in power, which is central to the play's unfolding tragedy.
 	
	Analysis:  The scene opens with King Duncan receiving reports about the ongoing battle against the Norwegian invaders and Scottish rebels. The wounded captain's account of Macbeth's bravery is central to this scene. Macbeth is depicted as a fearless and loyal warrior who has not only defeated the rebel Macdonald but also fought valiantly against the Norwegians. This portrayal of Macbeth as a hero sets the stage for his rise in power and establishes him as a character of great potential and valor. The audience is introduced to Macbeth through the lens of his battlefield prowess, creating an initial impression of him as a noble and honorable figure.A significant theme in this scene is the contrast between loyalty and betrayal. The Thane of Cawdor's treachery is revealed, highlighting the consequences of disloyalty. King Duncan's decision to execute the Thane of Cawdor and reward Macbeth with his title underscores the importance of loyalty in the play. This juxtaposition between the traitorous Cawdor and the loyal Macbeth sets up a recurring motif in the play: the thin line between loyalty and betrayal. It also foreshadows the internal conflict that Macbeth will face as he grapples with his own ambitions and the temptation to betray those who trust him.The scene is rich with foreshadowing and symbolic imagery. The execution of the Thane of Cawdor and the bestowal of his title upon Macbeth hint at the cyclical nature of power and betrayal. This act of rewarding Macbeth with the title of Thane of Cawdor foreshadows Macbeth's own future, suggesting that he might follow a similar path of ambition and treachery. The vivid descriptions of battle and bloodshed serve as symbols of the violent and chaotic nature of power struggles. The captain's bloody appearance and the graphic depiction of Macdonald's death underscore the brutality of the conflict and set a tone of foreboding for the rest of the play.King Duncan's character is also developed in this scene. His decision to reward Macbeth with the title of Thane of Cawdor demonstrates his trust and admiration for Macbeth. Duncan's actions reveal his benevolent and just nature, but they also highlight his vulnerability to betrayal. This decision sets the stage for the tragic events that follow, as Duncan's trust in Macbeth ultimately leads to his own downfall. The scene also introduces the audience to the political landscape of Scotland, where loyalty is rewarded, and treachery is severely punished.
	
	Poetic Devices: Imagery: Shakespeare uses vivid imagery to convey the horror and guilt associated with Duncan’s murder. For instance, Macbeth’s bloodstained hands symbolize his guilt and the irreversible nature of his actions.

Metaphor: Macbeth’s inability to say “Amen” and his hearing of a voice saying “Macbeth does murder sleep” are metaphors for his disturbed conscience and the psychological consequences of his crime.

Irony: There is situational irony in Lady Macbeth’s calm demeanor compared to Macbeth’s panic. Despite her initial composure, she later succumbs to guilt, showing the irony of her belief that "a little water clears us of this deed".

Hyperbole: Macbeth’s statement that not all the water in the world could wash the blood from his hands is an example of hyperbole, emphasizing the depth of his guilt.

Symbolism: Blood and sleeplessness are recurring symbols in this scene, representing guilt and the consequences of their actions.

Allusion: The knocking at the door alludes to the knocking of Macbeth’s heart, symbolizing his fear and paranoia.

Act 1,Scene 3:

	Summary:
On a heath near the battlefield, thunder rolls, and three witches appear. They discuss their recent activities, including killing swine and planning revenge on a sailor. Suddenly, a drum beats, and the third witch announces that Macbeth is approaching. Macbeth and Banquo encounter the witches on their way to King Duncan’s court. The witches hail Macbeth as Thane of Glamis (his original title) and Thane of Cawdor. They also predict that Macbeth will become king. Intrigued, Macbeth presses for more information, while Banquo learns that his descendants will sit on the throne.

	Analysis:
	
	 In this pivotal scene, we encounter the three witches (also known as the "weird sisters") and witness their ominous prophecies. On the heath, the witches appear, introducing themselves as the "weird sisters" and boasting of their dread and magical deeds. They mention killing swine and cursing a sailor to waste away, establishing their wickedness and supernatural power. When Macbeth and Banquo arrive, the witches hail Macbeth as Thane of Glamis (his current title), Thane of Cawdor (a title he doesn't yet hold), and "king hereafter." Banquo learns that his descendants will inherit the throne, even though he won't be king himself. The witches' predictions ignite Macbeth's ambition, and Banquo questions their motives. As Ross and Angus arrive, they inform Macbeth that he has been made the new Thane of Cawdor, fulfilling the witches' prophecy. Macbeth grapples with the implications: if fate says he'll become king, does he need to act to make it happen? His inner struggle begins, and he contemplates the terrifying thought of murder. In summary, Act 1, Scene 3 sets the stage for Macbeth's tragic journey, intertwining fate, ambition, and the supernatural. The witches' prophecies propel him toward a fateful decision. 

	Poetic devices:

1. Imagery:
   - The witches describe their magical deeds, such as killing swine and cursing a sailor to waste away. This vivid imagery establishes their wickedness and supernatural power.
   - Macbeth's internal struggle is depicted through imagery as well. He feels torn between ambition and fear, with his "seated heart" knocking at his ribs as he contemplates murder to fulfill the witches' prophecy.

2. Foreshadowing:
   - The witches' prophecies foreshadow Macbeth's rise to power and eventual downfall. Banquo's remark that the witches sometimes tell "half truths" hints at the consequences of Macbeth's actions.
   - Macbeth's thoughts about fate and whether he must act to make it happen foreshadow the tragic events that follow.

3. Metaphors:
   - Macbeth refers to committing regicide as "supernatural soliciting," acknowledging that it goes against the natural order. This metaphor emphasizes the gravity of his contemplated action.

4. Motifs:
   - The motif of the unnatural runs throughout the play. The witches, as supernatural beings, symbolize this theme, connecting politics and the environment.
   - Macbeth's struggle with ambition and fate is another recurring motif, leading to his tragic downfall.

Act 1,Scene4:

	Summary: At a camp near the battlefield, Malcolm informs King Duncan that the former Thane of Cawdor confessed and repented before his execution. Duncan reflects on trust and appearances, noting that outward shows can be deceiving. Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus enter. Duncan acknowledges Macbeth’s loyalty and service, but little does he know that Macbeth harbors dark desires. Duncan announces that Malcolm will be his heir, and he plans to visit Macbeth’s castle at Inverness.

	Analysis: At a camp near the battlefield, Malcolm informs King Duncan that the former Thane of Cawdor confessed and repented before his execution. Duncan reflects on trust, noting that appearances can be deceiving. Just as Duncan speaks about this, Macbeth enters the court, creating dramatic irony. Macbeth and Banquo exchange formal speeches, expressing loyalty to their king. Duncan praises Macbeth, stating that even the gift of Cawdor is not as much as Macbeth deserves. Duncan’s great strength lies in trusting his people, but this trust also makes him vulnerable to treachery.

Duncan compares himself to a gardener, emphasizing his role as a nurturing king who puts his country above his desires. He announces that Malcolm will be his heir to the Scottish throne (although kingship was not hereditary in Scotland at that time). Macbeth secretly reflects that Malcolm now stands between him and power, hinting at his intention to fulfill the witches’ prophecy. Unlike Duncan, Macbeth thinks in terms of what he can take, creating an adversarial relationship with nature.

	Poetic devices:
	1.Chiasmus: This rhetorical device involves reversing the order of words or phrases for emphasis. For instance, the witches’ famous 	line, “Fair is foul, and foul is fair,” exemplifies chiasmus.
	
	Antithesis: Antithesis juxtaposes contrasting ideas. The line “When the battle’s lost, and won” captures the paradoxical nature of 
	Macbeth’s situation.

	Imagery and Metaphor: Duncan’s use of imagery in this scene portrays Scotland as a vast garden, with himself as the caretaker. He says, 	“I have begun to plant thee and will labor to make thee full of growing”. This metaphor emphasizes Duncan’s role as king and his desire 	to nurture Macbeth’s growth.

1.What does Malcolm's speech about Thane of Cawdor's last moments signify?
   
2.What conflict arises in Macbeth after hearing the witches' prophecy and its resolution in Act 1, Scene 4?

Act 1 Scene 5:

	Summary:
	
	In Act 1, Scene 5 of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband, Macbeth, informing her about the witches’ prophecies. She fears that Macbeth is too kind-hearted to seize the throne by any means necessary. Determined to push him towards action, she resolves to question his manhood and ambition. When a messenger informs her that King Duncan will visit their castle that night, she sees it as the perfect opportunity to murder him. Lady Macbeth calls on supernatural forces to “unsex” her and fill her with cruelty, so she can carry out the deed. When Macbeth arrives, she tells him to act innocent and leave the plan to her.

	 Analysis:

	In Act 1, Scene 5 of Macbeth, Lady Macbeth emerges as a pivotal character, showcasing her ambition and determination. Upon reading Macbeth’s letter about the witches’ prophecies, she immediately fears that her husband lacks the ruthlessness needed to seize the throne. Her soliloquy reveals her willingness to cast aside her femininity and embrace cruelty, as she calls upon supernatural forces to “unsex” her and fill her with the resolve to commit regicide12. This scene highlights the stark contrast between Lady Macbeth’s unyielding ambition and Macbeth’s initial hesitation. Her manipulation of Macbeth, urging him to appear innocent while hiding his deadly intentions, sets the stage for the ensuing tragedy. Lady Macbeth’s character is thus established as both a driving force behind Macbeth’s actions and a symbol of unchecked ambition.

	Poetic devices:
1.Metaphor: Lady Macbeth uses metaphors to convey her thoughts and intentions. For instance, she asks to be filled "from the crown to the toe top-full of direst cruelty", comparing her body to a vessel that can be filled with evil.

2.Personification: Lady Macbeth personifies night and darkness when she calls on them to hide her deeds: "Come, thick night, / And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell". This gives a vivid image of darkness as a concealing force.

3.Apostrophe: She directly addresses abstract concepts like spirits and night, which is a form of apostrophe. For example, "Come, you spirits / That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here".

4. Irony: There is dramatic irony in Lady Macbeth's advice to Macbeth to "look like the innocent flower, / But be the serpent under't". The audience knows their true intentions, while other characters do not.

5.Imagery: Vivid imagery is used throughout the scene, particularly in Lady Macbeth's soliloquy. Her descriptions of darkness and cruelty create a powerful visual and emotional impact.

6.Allusion: The reference to the "serpent" under the flower alludes to the biblical story of the Garden of Eden, symbolizing deceit and evil.

The scene is filled with dramatic irony, as the audience knows that Duncan is walking into a trap.

	Analysis:

Act 1,Scene 7:

	Summary:
In this scene, Macbeth wrestles with his conscience about the plan to murder King Duncan. He acknowledges the reasons against the murder: Duncan is his kinsman, his king, and his guest, and Macbeth fears the moral and earthly consequences of such an act. Despite his ambition, he is hesitant and conflicted. Lady Macbeth enters and questions his manhood, manipulating him into following through with the plan. She outlines the details of the murder, convincing Macbeth to proceed with their plot.

	Analysis:
In Act 1, Scene 7 of Macbeth, Shakespeare delves deeply into Macbeth’s internal conflict and moral dilemma. Macbeth grapples with the consequences of murdering King Duncan, acknowledging that Duncan is not only his king and kinsman but also a guest in his home, which makes the act of murder even more heinous. He is acutely aware of the moral and earthly repercussions, fearing that "bloody instructions, which, being taught, return to plague the inventor". Despite his ambition, Macbeth’s conscience and sense of honor initially prevail, leading him to decide against the murder. However, Lady Macbeth’s entrance shifts the scene’s dynamic. She questions his manhood and resolve, using manipulative and provocative language to reignite his ambition and commitment to their plan. Her taunts and the detailed plan she outlines ultimately convince Macbeth to proceed with the regicide. This scene is pivotal as it highlights the themes of ambition, guilt, and the corrupting power of unchecked desires, setting the stage for the tragic events that follow.

4.Irony: There is dramatic irony in Lady Macbeth’s manipulation of Macbeth. She questions his manhood and resolve, unaware of the deep moral conflict he is experiencing.

5.Alliteration: Shakespeare uses alliteration to emphasize certain points and create a rhythmic flow. For example, Macbeth’s line “If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly” uses repeated ‘w’ sounds.
