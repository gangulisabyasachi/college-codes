Act 3, Scene 1:

	Summary:
In this scene, Banquo reflects on the witches' prophecy and suspects that Macbeth has played foul to achieve the throne. Meanwhile, Macbeth, now king, fears Banquo's noble nature and the prophecy that Banquo's descendants will inherit the throne. To secure his power, Macbeth hires two murderers to kill Banquo and his son, Fleance.

	Analysis:
In this scene, the theme of ambition and the corrupting influence of power are further explored. Macbeth's growing paranoia is evident as he begins to see Banquo as a threat, not just because of Banquo’s loyalty and noble character, but because of the witches' prophecy that Banquo's lineage will inherit the throne. Macbeth’s decision to hire murderers marks a significant moral decline, showcasing how his ambition drives him to commit increasingly heinous acts. This scene also highlights the contrast between Macbeth and Banquo; while Banquo is suspicious and cautious, Macbeth is consumed by his desire to secure his power, even at the cost of his humanity.

Act 3, Scene 3:


	Summary:
The two murderers, now joined by a third, ambush Banquo and Fleance on their way to the banquet. They successfully kill Banquo, but Fleance manages to escape. This failure deeply unsettles Macbeth, as Fleance's survival means the witches' prophecy about Banquo's descendants could still come true.


	Analysis:
This scene serves as a turning point in the play, where the consequences of Macbeth’s actions begin to spiral out of control. The successful murder of Banquo marks another step in Macbeth’s moral degradation, but the failure to kill Fleance introduces a new source of anxiety for Macbeth.

4.Irony: There is irony in the murderers’ success in killing Banquo but failing to kill Fleance, as Macbeth’s plan to secure his power is undermined.
