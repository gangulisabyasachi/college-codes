# Write a program in R to multiply each element of the above matrix by 3

# ar*3

# when we run this code after day2p8.R, the array_5x3 variable is already stored in the session. so no need to write the whole code again.
print(array_5x3 * 3)

# Output
#  [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]  156  186  216
# [2,]  162  192  222
# [3,]  168  198  228
# [4,]  174  204  234
# [5,]  180  210  240
