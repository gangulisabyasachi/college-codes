# Write a program in R to multiply elements of the matrix obtained in 8 in the order 2,3,4 (first element by 2, second element by 3, third element by 4, fourth element again by 2, and so on)


# ar*2:4


# when we run this code after day2p8.R, the array_5x3 variable is already stored in the session. so no need to write the whole code again.
print(array_5x3 * 2:4)

# Output
#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]  104  248  216
# [2,]  162  128  296
# [3,]  224  198  152
# [4,]  116  272  234
# [5,]  180  140  320
